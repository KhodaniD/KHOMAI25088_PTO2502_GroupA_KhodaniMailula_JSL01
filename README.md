# Kanban Board Project

---

## Project Title

**Kanban Board UI Implementation**

---

## Project Description

This project implements a basic Kanban board web application, designed to help users visualize and manage their workflow. It features a **responsive layout** that adapts gracefully to both desktop and mobile screens. The board displays tasks organized into "TODO," "DOING," and "DONE" columns, providing a clear overview of progress. 

The current version focuses purely on the structural and visual presentation of a static Kanban board, showcasing a **desktop sidebar for navigation** and a streamlined mobile layout.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For structuring the content and defining the elements of the web page.

* **CSS3**: For styling the application, including layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.

    * **CSS Variables**: Used to define a theme's color palette, making it easy to manage and potentially switch themes.

    * **Flexbox**: Utilized for responsive layout of various components.

    * **CSS Grid**: Employed for arranging the Kanban columns.

* **Google Fonts**: Specifically, 'Plus Jakarta Sans', for consistent and modern typography.

## Working Usage Examples

### Desktop View:

* Open `index.html` in a desktop browser.
* Observe the full-width sidebar on the left with the Kanban logo and board list.
* The main content area will display the "Launch Career" title and the "TODO," "DOING," and "DONE" columns arranged horizontally.
* Resize your browser window to simulate different desktop screen sizes; the columns will adjust their layout.

### Mobile View:

* Open `index.html` in a mobile browser or use your desktop browser's developer tools to enable device emulation (e.g., Chrome DevTools -> Toggle device toolbar).
* The desktop sidebar will disappear.
* The header will show a compact "Kanban" logo along with the "Launch Career" board title.
* The Kanban columns ("TODO," "DOING," "DONE") will stack vertically, making them easily scrollable on smaller screens.

## Interaction Instructions

This project currently provides a **static visual representation** of a Kanban board. As such, direct interaction with tasks (e.g., dragging, dropping, editing, deleting) is not implemented in this version.

* **Viewing Boards:** The "Launch Career" board is pre-selected and displayed. While the structure allows for multiple boards, the current implementation does not include functionality to switch between them dynamically.

This Kanban board provides a solid foundation for future development, like adding interactive features for tasks and board management!
